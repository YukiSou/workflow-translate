# workflow-translate

A couple of Automator workflows to translate the selected text with Google
Translate.

The `Google Translate` workflow can receive any text: just right click on the
selected text and chose "Google Translate" from the "Services" contextual
menu.

A few applications, like macOS's Preview, won't allow to do that, though.
The `Google Translate Selection` workflow works around that by copying the
selected text to the clipboard and translating from there. It has to be called
from the application's menu (instead of the contextual menu).


## Instalation

Just double click the `.workflow` files. You can add keyboard shortcuts by
going to the keyboard preferences, selecting "Shortcuts" and then "Services".
